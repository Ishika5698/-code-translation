# 🚀 LLM-Augmented JavaScript to TypeScript Translator

**Translate JavaScript to TypeScript with blazing speed and precision!**  
This project is an **LLM-augmented code translation system** that leverages the power of the **Llama language model** to convert JavaScript code into TypeScript. With **65% reduced latency** and **enhanced semantic preservation**, this tool is designed to make your code migration seamless and efficient.
